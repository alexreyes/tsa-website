                <p>Manheim Township High School will offer the following Technology Education classes during the upcoming 2016-2017 school year:</p>
                <p><strong>Energy, Power &amp; Transportation (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>Students will study energy sources, uses, and conversion mechanisms as they are related to energy and transportation systems. Learning activities include designing, building, and testing mechanical energy conversion devices, model transportation devices and electronic control system devices. Various industrial materials and manufacturing equipment are essential to the hands-on problem solving activities based around the technology problem-solving method. This course provides a foundation for the Electricity/Electronics and Applied Engineering courses.</p>
                <p><strong>Woodworking 1 (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course is designed to introduce basic manufacturing processes in a materials technology environment. The student will learn about basic woodworking by using wood shop tools and machines to make at least two unique wood projects. The first project will be a common class project made by each student. This project will then be compared to a class-manufactured project.</p>
                <p><strong>Metal Technology 1 (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course is a hands-on study of technology in the areas of metalworking and plastics. Students are required to use laboratory equipment to gain experience and learn the fundamentals of using tools and processing materials in each area. Safety, troubleshooting and problem-solving techniques are emphasized throughout the course. Students are required to make well-designed, practical projects in each area of study.</p>
                <p><strong>Graphics 1 (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course is an introductory course to Graphic Design and Printing. Students will learn to use their creativity to design and produce printed images for various design challenges. To create their solutions students will use state of the art software programs like Adobe InDesign&reg; and Photoshop&reg;, and will be introduced to printing methods such as Silkscreen printing and Offset printing</p>
                <p><strong>Graphics 2 (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course enables students to develop advanced skills as Graphic Designers. The course focuses on the digital applications of visual communications. Students will use state of the art software programs like Adobe InDesign&reg;, Photoshop&reg; and Illustrator&reg;. They will design solutions to challenges from the instructor, as well as outside design challenges, that will help develop their design, printing and presentation skills. Digital photography will be covered along with other digital-related communication methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Video Production 1 (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This project-based course introduces the video production process. Students are introduced to basic pre and post-production skills of storyboarding, scriptwriting, camera techniques, visual composition, sound gathering and lighting techniques. The class will be instructed in Adobe Premiere editing software to create a variety of group and individual video projects.</p>
                <p><strong>Video Production 2 (Grades 10/11/12) </strong></p>
                <p>This project-based course builds on concepts introduced in Video Production 1 and encourages students to increase their proficiency in videography and explore advanced editing techniques. More emphasis will be placed on advanced camera functions, lighting and sound options and story development. Students will work independently to produce a variety of projects for the morning TV broadcast (feature and sports stories, commercials, interviews, commentaries) as well as an original short feature.</p>
                <p><strong>Video Production 3 (Grades 11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>The Video Production 3 class is responsible for the planning, production and broadcast of Blue Streak News. Rotating through each position, students will train in all job responsibilities, including lighting, camera and teleprompter operation, graphics, sound and video mixing, directing and news scriptwriting. Specific production assignments are included in each rotation. Students are evaluated on their contribution to and their performance during the broadcast.</p>
                <p><strong>Video Production 4 (Grades 11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>The Video Production 4 students will have the opportunity to advance their skills in areas that they have practiced during earlier levels of video production: creating news, feature, and sports stories, original short videos, documentaries or animated shorts for the school broadcast. Students may be called on to assist with the morning broadcast, if needed or may choose to concentrate their efforts in that area. Students in Video Production 4 should plan to enter a minimum of two projects in local or national contests throughout the semester. They may select their own format and contest as available.</p>
                <p><strong>Architectural Drawing 1 (Grades 11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This introductory course acquaints the student with the design process used for planning a typical residence. The subject includes a brief historical review of architectural styles and their relation to modern structures. Architectural features such as materials and spatial requirements are studied and applied as the student designs and develops his/her own set of house plans by means of sketching, mechanical drawing and CAD.</p>
                <p><strong>PLTW: Introduction to Engineering Design (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This computer intensive course is one of two introductory courses in the Project Lead the Way engineering program that is offered through the STEM Academy. Introduction to Engineering Design teaches students the process of product design through the use of CAD and computer modeling software. Students use a problem-solving model to improve existing products and invent new ones. They also learn how to apply this model both in and out of the classroom. Emphasis is placed on analyzing potential solutions, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and communicating the ideas to others.</p>
                <p><strong>PLTW: Principles of Engineering Design (Grades 9/10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course provides an overview of the world of engineering. Students will develop problem-solving skills by tackling real-world engineering problems. This course provides a hands-on approach to science, math, and technology. Through theory and practical hands-on experience, students will become familiar with the multifaceted career of engineering. This course will explore the following topics: mechanisms, energy sources, energy applications, machine control, fluid power, statics, material properties, material testing, statistics, and kinematics. Students will work on projects such as energy transfer devices, marble &ldquo;trash&rdquo; sorters, structural design and testing, pneumatic systems, electronic control systems, ping-pong ball launchers, hero&rsquo;s engines, and a material tensile testing activity.</p>
                <p><strong>PLTW: Aerospace Engineering (Grades 10/11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course engages students in engineering design problems related to the world of aviation and space travel. Using hands-on, project based learning, students will explore concepts related to: aerospace information systems, astronautics, rocketry, propulsion, the physics and biology of space science, principles of aeronautics, aviation structures and materials, and systems control engineering.</p>
                <p><strong>PLTW: Civil Engineering and Architecture (Grades 11/12)</strong></p>
                <p>This course offers students the fundamental knowledge and experience to apply mathematical, scientific, and engineering principles to the design, development, and evaluation of a property.
