                <p class="lead">1. Delivery:</p>
				<p>Drones can allow business, such as Amazon, deliver products to customers with out having to send a deliver person to deliver the package. Recently, Amazon announced that their drone delivery system which would allow them to send packages quicker."We're excited about Prime Air — a future delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using small unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Putting Prime Air into service will take some time, but we will deploy when we have the regulatory support needed to realize our vision." said by trh CEO on Amazon. Not only would not it be easier to deliver packages, but it would also be easier to deilver food. If a UAV-based food deliver system is ever implemented, it would allow for food to be delivered quicker. You may wonder why this has not been implemented yet. It would be ground breaking in the fast food delivery system. Last year, in California, a group of researchers tested to see if they could drop a burrito using the UAV system that uses a GPS to drop it. Also, last year, Domino’s made a video and uploaded it to YouTube, showing the drone delivering a box of pizza.</p>

				<p class="lead">2.News and Photogrpahy:</p>
				<p>In the past few years companies such as DJI and GoPro have created tools to help content produces to make higher quality videos. The picture bellow is a picture of a drone with a camera on it that can be controlled by from a smartphone. In many modern movies, there are aerial shoots such as a high speed chase or a cliff scene. Also it can record an explosion scene, which could not be recorded by a person trying to film it. Similarly to this, photographers can use this to get pictures of real estate and property that people want to look at.This can also be used for occasions such as weddings and parties. In the recent years, more and more drones are being used to take pictures during wedding to get amazing shots, although this is very expensive." In July, New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney got into hot water after hiring a wedding photographer to shoot his nuptials from the air with a drone. The FAA forbids the toys from being used for commercial purposes. Had Maloney taken the shots himself, without any money changing hands, the photos would have been legal." </p>

				<p class="lead">3. Scientific Uses:</p>
				<p>"The use of drones in science has taken a similarly roundabout route. NASA first experimented with custom-built UAVs in high-altitude research during the 1970s, but unmanned planes have been slow to catch on. Drones with top-notch sensors were too expensive to tempt researchers and cheap versions could not offer much of value. During the past decade, however, lower prices and technical advances — from on-board navigation using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to miniaturization of autopilots — have lured many scientific groups to experiment with UAVs." In forests such as the Amazon, the forest is so dense that it would take too much time and man hours to explorer the entire forest. As of now, only 20% to the living species have been found. There are still 80% of living species which have not been found which we could find drones. You could also use this to explorer areas that are uninhabited due to the harsh weather such as the Arctic Circle or the inside of an active volcano. This would allow scientist to find new discoveries. There are also ocean drones that can go underwater and explore that deep ocean. This would allow use to deeper under water without being crushed by pressure of the water.</p>
