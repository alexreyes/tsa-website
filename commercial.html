                <p class="lead">1. Delivery:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Drones can allow a business, such as Amazon, to deliver products to customers without having to spend money on a delivery person which results in a cost effective way of getting shipments to customers. Recently, Amazon announced their new drone delivery which would allow them to send packages in a quicker manner."We're excited about Prime Air — a future delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using small unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system. Putting Prime Air into service will take some time, but we will deploy when we have the regulatory support needed to realize our vision." said the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. The interesting thing about Drone delivery is it would also allow food shipments becoming more common and more widely available. Additionally Domino’s made a video and uploaded it to YouTube, showing off their drone delivering a box of pizza. The most exciting thing is this is only the beginning for the potential Drone delivery has in store for us.</p>

                <p class="lead"> 2. News and Photogrpahy:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">In the past few years, companies such as DJI and GoPro have created tools to help content producers make higher quality videos. The picture below is a picture of a drone with a camera on it that can be controlled by from a smartphone. Drones have not been limited to delivering items only. In fact, in many modern movies, there are aerial shots such as a high-speed chases or a cliff scenes. Although most people may never notice, most are done using a drone. Also, Drones can be used to record explosion scenes, which would not have been possible to do with a person trying to film it from a nearby distance. Similarly, photographers can use these capabilities to get pictures of real estate and property that people want to look at from aerial point of views. Another common example of Drone photography used in daily life is pictures for weddings and parties. </p>

                <p class="lead">3. Scientific Uses:</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 3em;">"The use of drones in science has also exploded in use. NASA first experimented with custom-built UAVs in high-altitude research during the late 1970s, but unmanned planes have been slow to catch on. Drones with top-notch sensors were too expensive to tempt researchers and cheap versions could not offer much of value. During the past decade, however, lower prices and technical advances — from onboard navigation using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to miniaturization of autopilots — have lured many scientific groups to experiment with UAVs." In forests such as the Amazon, the forest is so dense that it would take too much time and man hours to explore the entire forest. As of now, only 20% of the living species have been found. There are still 80% of living species which have not been found which we could find drones. You could also use this to explore areas that are uninhabited due to the harsh weather such as the Arctic Circle or the inside of an active volcano. This would allow scientist to find new discoveries. There are also ocean drones that can go underwater and explore that deep ocean. This would allow use to deeper under water without being crushed by the pressure of the water.</p>
